title: "Personal Rebranding"
---

Roughly six years ago I watched Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.
Not too long after I was registering for some online service, and was trying to
think of a username. I tried variants such as "bootstrapbillturner" and
"jacksparrow". At one point, my finger slipped, and I ended up with "dvyjones".

Six years later, and that's still the username I use everywhere. It's more
unique than you would think, as far as I know I am the only one using it. Until
recently, I never really thought about my username, I just used it. I didn't
even know how to pronounce it.

In June, I went to my first ever conference: [EuRuKo][euruko]. I had a lot of
fun there, but the more people I was giving my Twitter and GitHub username to,
the more I realised how little I liked that username. It's not nearly as bad as
one of my old usernames, "harrypottergeek9393x", but I still didn't feel
comfortable with my username.

So, a few days ago, I set out on a mission to find a new username. I really
only had three criteria: The new username had to be available on Twitter,
GitHub and as a domain. After considering different options and looking at what
other people were doing, I ended up with "henrikhodne". I like it.
