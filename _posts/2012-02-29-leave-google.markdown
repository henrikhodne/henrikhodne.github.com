title: "Leave Google"
---

I’ve used Gmail for my main email hosting since I got an invite in 2005, and
I’ve loved it. However, I’ve started to feel less good about not paying for my
email hosting lately, and that combined with some privacy issues that has come
up made me decide to move off Google alltogether. So, I thought I’d write up on
what I’ve changed to. Some of these I’ve used before Google, or I didn’t use
Google’s service at all, but I thought I’d list them since they can replace a
Google service.

## FastMail.fm

For email I’m using FastMail.fm. I have an Enhanced account set up with my own
domains, and so far I really like it. They have a pretty nice web interface,
which works for the few times I need it, and they provide IMAP access. They
also give you some pretty powerful filtering abilities, although they aren’t as
easy to configure as Gmail’s.

The Enhanced account, which is the only one that allows you to add custom
domains, costs $39.95/year, which gives you 10 GB of storage. FastMail also
provides an IMAP migrator that copies all your files over from an IMAP account.
I’ve used it on three different accounts now, and it seems to work flawlessly.

## iCloud

I use iCloud for contacts and calendars. Some might argue that Apple is no
better than Google, but at least I give Apple money through buying apps and
buying several of their products. Since I have a MacBook Pro, an iPhone and an
iPad, the fact that they sync together nicely (I’ve never had any
syncronization problems) is a huge plus.

## DuckDuckGo

DuckDuckGo is, according to their website, a search engine with:

* Way more instant answers.
* Way less spam and clutter.
* Lots and lots of goodies.
* Real privacy.

They’re not as instant as Google, but they’re definitely fast enough. They
don’t have image searching or anything fancy like that, but 99% of the time I’m
just looking for text, anyways. The fact that they don’t track or bubble you is
really nice as well.

## Dropbox

[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) is awesome. It’s as easy as that. The concept
behind it is really simple: You have a folder. It synchronises. Dropbox has
managed to get file synchronisation done right, and fast. If you’re using some
other service to synchronise files, try them out (they’re free).

If you have any suggestions for other services, or there are some other Google services you’re trying to get rid off, send me a tweet (I’m @[henrikhodne](http://twitter.com/henrikhodne)), or [email me](mailto:me@henrikhodne.com).
